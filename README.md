## Inspiration
Throughout history, women have had to sacrifice themselves for the next generation. They did not have the opportunities or encouragement from society to take the steps that we have been presented with and seized. They‚Äôve sacrificed their own time, energy and opportunities to enable us to be able to share our inner intelligence, vision, creativity and talents with all . That‚Äôs so powerful and we're so thankful. And that is why we wanted to help them grow, to help them learn and to empower them to become a more successful and happy person.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÖüèÜ
The implementation of the entire project helped us realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a team In every Hackathon, proper time management plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; we understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback. We are proud of completing the project in time.

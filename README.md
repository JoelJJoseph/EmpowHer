## Inspiration
Throughout history, women have had to sacrifice themselves for the next generation. They did not have the opportunities or encouragement from society to take the steps that we have been presented with and seized. They‚Äôve sacrificed their own time, energy and opportunities to enable us to be able to share our inner intelligence, vision, creativity and talents with all . That‚Äôs so powerful and we're so thankful. And that is why we wanted to help them grow, to help them learn and to empower them to become a more successful and happy person.
